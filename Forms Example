<!-- When this type is used, the user is required to type a valid e-mail address into the field; any other content causes the browser to display an error when the form is submitted. Note that this is client-side error validation, performed by the browser: -->
<h4>Email</h4>
<form>
	<input type="email" id="email" name="email" multiple>
</form>

<!-- The main difference between a text field and a search field is how the browser styles it â€” often, search fields are rendered with rounded corners, and/or given an "x" to press to clear the entered value. However, there is another added feature worth noting: their values can be automatically saved to be auto completed across multiple pages on the same site -->
<h4>Search</h4>
<form>
	<input type="search" id="search" name="search">
</form>


<!-- The main difference between a textarea and a regular single line text field is that users are allowed to type text that includes hard line breaks (i.e. pressing return). -->
<h4>Text Area</h4>
<form>
	<textarea cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
</form>


<!-- A check box is created using the <input> element with its type attribute set to the value checkbox.vv -->
<h4>Checkbox</h4>
<form>
	<input type="checkbox" checked id="carrots" name="carrots" value="carrots">
</form>	

<!-- A button is created using a <button> element or an <input> element. It's the value of the type attribute that specifies what kind of button is displayed: -->
<h4>Submit Button</h4>
<form>	
	<button type="submit">
    This a <br><strong> strong submit button with br</strong>
	</button>
	<input type="submit" value="This is a submit button">
